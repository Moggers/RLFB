## Prequisites

* [Vulkan](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)
* [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [ASSIMP](https://www.assimp.org/) (Not actually used since we have no assets, but implemented for testing)

## Building
* `make build`

Alternatively;
* `make watch` to watch the source files and rebuild.. Useful when being a renderdoc jockey.

_Ignore the backup make target_
